The task mentioned in the assignment, has been completed by me and the code to that is in this git repository.
These APIs have been created using Visual Studio in C#.
All the data types, location, date-time, etc... are defined in the Model Classes.
The in memory database contains the given types of alarm, etc.
The Controller has all the APIs in commented form.
The database has 2 tables one for login credentials and one for all other functions.
The fields of both tables have all the variables given in the assignment document shared.

For any further details, help regarding the code, please raise an issue in this repository.
